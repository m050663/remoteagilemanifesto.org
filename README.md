## Manifesto for Remote Agile Work

We would like to work with the greatest remote and agile working teams, agile leaders and workers around the world to update and change the great [agile manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/) with your and our experience about remote agile work in it's focus.

The wonderful and today famous agile manifesto says:

> ### Manifesto for Agile Software Development
> 
> We are uncovering better ways of developing
> software by doing it and helping others do it.
> Through this work we have come to value:
> 
> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
> Working software over comprehensive documentation
> Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
> Responding to change over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on
> the right, we value the items on the left more.

and it continues to with the 'Principles behind the Agile Manifesto'

> ### Principles behind the Agile Manifesto
> 
> We follow these principles:
> 1) Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
> through early and continuous delivery
> of valuable software.
> 
> 2) Welcome changing requirements, even late in 
> development. Agile processes harness change for 
> the customer's competitive advantage.
> 
> 3) Deliver working software frequently, from a 
> couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
> preference to the shorter timescale.
> 
> 4) Business people and developers must work 
together daily throughout the project.
> 
> 5) Build projects around motivated individuals. 
> Give them the environment and support they need, 
> and trust them to get the job done.
> 
> 6) The most efficient and effective method of 
> conveying information to and within a development 
> team is face-to-face conversation.
> 
> 7) Working software is the primary measure of progress.
> 
> 8) Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
> The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
> to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
> 
> 9) Continuous attention to technical excellence 
> and good design enhances agility.
> 
> 10) Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount 
> of work not done--is essential.
> 
> 11) The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
> emerge from self-organizing teams.
> 
> 12) At regular intervals, the team reflects on how 
> to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
> its behavior accordingly.

How should it look like with remote agile teams and agile work in it's focus? How does it change when we not only talk about software development, but agile work in all areas of the company?

A key point for us is to challenge principle 6). 
According to the considerations in our book (see below) one should differentiate between 

a) convergent communication scenarios (e.g. taking a decision, solving conflicts, solving problems, etc) and divergent scenarios (e.g. brainstorming, getting to know each other, etc.) and
b) synchronous media (e.g. f2f, telephone, video conference, etc.) and asynchronous media (e.g. email, text messages, blog, etc.)
Following our thoughts in our book one should use synchronous media for convergent communication scenarios.
Thus in our language und with our expertise 6') could read:

6') The most efficient and effective method of 
> solving conflicts, making decisions, and similar converging communication scenarios is a synchronous conversation.

We are looking forward to your feedback and possible enrichments.
